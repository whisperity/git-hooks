Git `hooks`
===========

This repository contains a few [Git hook scripts](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) that I use across my projects.

They are in no particular order or fit for any purpose.
All hooks are implemented as shell scripts, as conventional.
Please check the individual hook scripts' preamble to read a one-liner on what they do.
The names try to be indicative.

Usage
-----

I use [`@rycus86`](http://github.com/rycus86)'s [Githooks](http://github.com/rycus86/githooks) manager for my local working directories.
This repository is intended to be used as a _Shared hook repository_ via this manager.
Here's an install script for the thing from my [`.`-files repository](http://github.com/whisperity/dotfiles/blob/master/packages/githooks/package.yaml).
